Entur operates the national registry for all public transport in Norway, collecting data from 60 public transportation operators. The registry contains data about 75,000 daily departures on 4,700 routes. This data is open and free of charge for app and service developers.

Open source is important to us – and here on GitHub you will find all our open source projects.
