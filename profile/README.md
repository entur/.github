# Welcome to Entur

Entur connects Norway's public transport and supplies the companies with digital services built for the future.

Entur operates the national registry for all public transport in Norway, collecting data from 60 public transportation operators. The registry contains data about 75,000 daily departures on 4,700 routes. This data is open and free of charge for app and service developers.

Open source is important to us – and here on GitHub you will find all our open source projects.

## Get Involved

As a developer you might want to check out our [Developer Portal](https://developer.entur.org/) first. There you will find information about all the available data sets, services and APIs.
